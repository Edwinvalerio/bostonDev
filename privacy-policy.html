          <p>If you use our App, we also collect the following information: Push Notifications. We may request to send
            you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the App. If you wish to opt-out from
            receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings. This information
            is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, for troubleshooting and for our
            internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

          <p>2. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</p>

          <p>In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services,

          <p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>

          <p>Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information

            achieve our legitimate business interests. Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract
            with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract. Legal Obligations:
            We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable
            law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a
            court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law
            enforcement requirements). Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is
            necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected
            fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as
            evidence in litigation in which we are involved. More specifically, we may need to process your data or
            share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

          <p>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations
            of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
            another company. Affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will
            require those affiliates to honor this privacy notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any

            with us. Business Partners. We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain
            products, services or promotions. Other Users. When you share personal information or otherwise interact

            available outside the App in perpetuity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your
            activity, communicate with you within our App, and view your profile. 3. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER
            TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>

          <p>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>

          <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
            information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies
            is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

          <p>4. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</p>

          <p>In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>

          <p>Our servers are located in. If you are accessing our App from outside, please be aware that your
            information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties
            with whom we may share your personal information (see &quot;WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH
            ANYONE?&quot; above), in and other countries. If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then
            these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as
            those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in
            accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>

          <p>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

          <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
            privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

          <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
            other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
            longer than __________.</p>

          <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
            delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

          <p>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

          <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

          <p></p>

          <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your
            personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
            authority. You can find their contact details here:
            http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm. If you are a resident in
            Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here:
            https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html. 7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
            (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard
            for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
            browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
            If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
            that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

          <p>8. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

          <p>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to
            your personal information.</p>

          <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &quot;Shine The Light&quot; law, permits our users
            who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information
            about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing
            purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the
            immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
            please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>

          <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you

            such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address
            associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is
            not publicly displayed on the App, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or
            comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).</p>

          <p>9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</p>

          <p></p>

            changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently
            to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
